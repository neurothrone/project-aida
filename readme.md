## About

This repository houses the source code for a web application powered by the Django framework. It's preliminary called AIDA (Artificial Intelligence Data Advisor).
Its purpose is to allow a user to store and track a history of measurable metrics, in an effort to keep a history of progress and to discover patterns through observations and visualizations; manually and eventually through AI-assistance.

The metrics to focus primarily on initially, subdivided into the following categories:
- Activity
  - Training performance
- Health
  - Blood pressure
  - Heart rate
  - Sleep
- Interests
  - Books
  - Games
  - Movies

## Roadmap

- [ ] Visualization
- [ ] Support for other users (authentication, registration, profiles)
- [ ] Advanced database functionality
- [ ] AI Integration
- [ ] \(Optional) User Message system
