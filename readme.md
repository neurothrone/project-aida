## About
This repository houses the source code for a web application powered by the Django framework. It's preliminary called AIDA (Artificial Intelligence Data Advisor).
Its purpose is to allow a user to store and track a history of measurable metrics, in an effort to keep a history of progress and to discover patterns through observations and visualizations; manually and eventually through AI-assistance.

The metrics to focus primarily on at first subdivided into the following categories:
- Activity
  - Workouts
- Health
  - Heart
  - Sleep
  - Body weight
- Interests (Undetermined)
  - Books
  - Games
  - Movies
